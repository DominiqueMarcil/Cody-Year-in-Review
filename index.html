                <h2>MY GROWTH THROUGH 2023</h2>
        <p>     In November 2022, I took a leap by reaching out to the Lethbridge Hurricanes photographer, igniting a passion that has propelled my photography and videography journey to incredible heights over the past year. 
         Since that momentous decision, I have experienced remarkable professional growth, capturing the electrifying moments of sporting events like the Calgary Stampede and FIS World Cup, CSEC, CEBL, the energy of concerts, and the behind-the-scenes magic of spec commercials for Mercedes & NIKE. My lens has not only witnessed grand spectacles but has also spotlighted the stories of local businesses.
         I am very appreciative of all the people who have helped me along the way. While challenges tested my skills and confidence, they only fueled my creative drive, and I'm eager to continue pushing boundaries, aiming for greater heights, and creating unforgettable memories through my work. The journey has just begun, and I'm excited to see where the future leads in the dynamic world of photography and videography.
